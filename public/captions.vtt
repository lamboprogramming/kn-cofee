00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.000
So we focus on quality at Kiwi Nutz. 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Number one, we use the highest end machine available.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Number two, we ship beans to you directly.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.500
Our signature blend is sourced from three countries

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.000
Columbia, Brazil, and Ethiopia

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And if you know anything about coffee, Ethiopia is the home of coffee 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
so it's very very premium

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.500
And lastly, we use real milk to make lattes and cappuccinos,

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.000
which is much better quality than using powdered milk.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.500
So the service piece of Kiwi Nutz is quite important.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.500
We're in the office regularly maintaining and cleaning that machine.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.000
We're using real milk, so you want to take care of that line

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.500
and you want to make sure the machines are well maintained.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.500
And we take care of the maintenance and cleaning on that machine

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.000
so that's one less thing that the office needs to worry about.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.000
With Kiwi Nutz, you've now got cafe quality coffee right in the office place,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So your employees no longer need to leave the office to get a decent cappucino.
